									<h6>St Michan’s Church, Church Street, Smithfield</h6>
									The interior of St. Michan's is notable for its fine woodwork, a large organ from 1724 on which Handel is said to have played his Messiah (it is one of the oldest still in use in Ireland), a Penitent's Stool, and a chalice dating from 1516. The pulpit and font date from the 18th century.
									But the main highlight for most visitors is the burial vault underneath the church. Because of the dry atmosphere created by its limestone walls, centuries-old bodies interred here remain remarkably intact.
									Guided tours lead visitors into a stone tunnel lined with burial chambers, where some of the dusty corpses can be admired in their open coffins. Among these are a nun, a man missing a hand and both feet, and a Crusader who had to be sawn in half to fit into the coffin. Legend has it that Bram Stoker's Dracula was inspired in part by the author's childhood visits to this macabre vault.
